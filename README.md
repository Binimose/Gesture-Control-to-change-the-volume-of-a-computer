# Gesture Control to Change the Volume of a Computer

This project uses hand tracking with OpenCV and MediaPipe to control the system volume based on hand gestures. The application detects the distance between the thumb and index finger to adjust the volume, with real-time visual feedback on the screen.

## Features

- **Hand Tracking**: Tracks the hand and finger movements using MediaPipe.
- **Volume Control**: Adjusts the system volume based on the distance between the thumb and index finger.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Displays the volume level and FPS on the screen.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe
- Numpy
- Pycaw (Python Core Audio Windows Library for audio control on Windows)

## Installation
